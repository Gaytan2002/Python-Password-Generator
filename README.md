# Python-Password-Generator
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
As an enhanced honors project for my Math class, I created a password generator using Python to demonstrate some of the concepts used from discrete mathematics into building a program in which can enhance your cybersecurity.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used 
- **Python 3.x** â€“ Core programming language used to implement the password generation logic  
- **Tkinter** *(optional)* â€“ Used to build a graphical user interface (GUI), if applicable  
- **random** â€“ Built-in Python module used to select random characters for password creation  
- **string** â€“ Used to access character sets (letters, digits, punctuation)  
- **pyperclip** *(optional)* â€“ Enables copying the generated password to the system clipboard  
- **VS Code / IDLE / Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Development environments used during coding and testing  
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and project hosting
